1. Proper Use of Abstraction

Abstract Class:

Java
abstract class LibraryItem {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private int publicationYear;

    public LibraryItem(String title, String author, int publicationYear) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.publicationYear = publicationYear;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
        return title;
    }

    public String getAuthor() {
        return author;
    }

    public int getPublicationYear() {
        return publicationYear;
    }

    public Â  
 abstract void displayInfo();
}
Use code with caution.

Interface:

Java
interface Searchable {
    boolean matches(String query);
}
Use code with caution.

2. Encapsulation

The LibraryItem class encapsulates its data members (title, author, publicationYear) and provides access to them through getters. This prevents direct modification of the internal state and ensures data integrity.

3. Polymorphism

The displayInfo() method in the LibraryItem class is abstract, allowing subclasses like Book and Magazine to provide their own implementations. This demonstrates polymorphism, where objects of different types can be treated as objects of a common superclass.

Java
class Book extends LibraryItem implements Searchable {
    // ...
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        // Specific book display logic
    }

    @Override
    public boolean matches(String query) {
        // Search logic for books
    }
}

class Magazine extends LibraryItem implements Searchable {
    // ...
    @Override
    public void displayInfo() {
        // Specific magazine display logic
    }

    @Override
    public boolean matches(String query) {
        // Search logic for magazines
    }
}
Use code with caution.

4. Code Organization, Readability, and Comments

Clear Class and Method Naming: Use descriptive names to convey the purpose of classes and methods.
Consistent Formatting: Adhere to consistent indentation, spacing, and other formatting conventions.
Meaningful Comments: Explain the purpose of code sections, especially for complex algorithms or non-obvious logic.
Modular Design: Break down the code into smaller, well-defined modules to improve maintainability.
Error Handling: Consider adding error handling mechanisms to handle potential exceptions and provide informative error messages.
By following these principles, you can create well-structured, readable, and maintainable code.
