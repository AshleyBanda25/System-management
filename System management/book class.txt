Explanation:

Inheritance: The Book class extends LibraryItem and implements Borrowable.
Additional Attributes: author and isbn are added to store specific book information.
Concrete Methods:
getDetails(): This method provides specific details about the book, including its author and ISBN.
isAvailable(): This method checks the isAvailable flag to determine if the book is currently available for borrowing.
borrow(): This method sets the isAvailable flag to false to indicate that the book is borrowed.
returnItem(): This method sets the isAvailable flag to true to indicate that the book is returned and available for borrowing.
By implementing the Borrowable interface, the Book class provides a consistent way to manage the borrowing and returning process.
